** high prio
*** DONE fix ctrl areas of DecMer and ForkJoin
CLOSED: [2011-06-04 Sat 03:48]
size/position is wrong
more beautiful
*** DONE enable adding multiple in a row
CLOSED: [2011-06-04 Sat 03:46]
**** needs beautification of ctrl areas
*** DONE rake area to show activity on next level
CLOSED: [2011-05-20 Fri 09:24]
**** layers to generate initial activity for layer0
**** click rake area tells current layer to rake the action (persistent)
**** current layer tells next layer to show the activity
*** DONE menubar (from scratch)
CLOSED: [2011-05-25 Wed 21:53]
now layer-local
**** action, decmer, forkjoin
**** drag item onto edge
**** menubar could have instances of the nodes
**** who handles the procedure?
*** DONE menubar delete
CLOSED: [2011-06-04 Sat 03:47]
**** tell paths to remove the node
*** DONE generate new path
CLOSED: [2011-05-25 Wed 21:51]
**** idea: drop new final node onto an area of a forkjoin/decmer
they have areas corresponding to the space: above, between and below
their outgoing edges
*** DONE instrospection tool for data model
CLOSED: [2011-06-14 Tue 02:12]
there needs to be a debugger window that shows all paths and elements
in a concise way.

content of all collections with selected attributes, cid for a start

content of paths listing path idx and nodes as cid lists
*** DONE BUG: newpath with only MIMO leads to wrong insertion
CLOSED: [2011-06-14 Tue 02:12]
factor out stuff and write tests for it
*** DONE BUG: removing left last path with idx != 0
CLOSED: [2011-06-14 Tue 02:59]
factor out stuff and write tests for it
*** DONE Graph/vertices instead of paths
CLOSED: [2011-07-12 Tue 01:46]
*** DONE fix x_req/y_req - edges have also space and padding?
CLOSED: [2011-07-12 Tue 01:48]
elements have a size, optional x/y padding which needs to be accounted
for in the space allocation

--> edges have no real space, the edge area is drawn along the arrow,
    the arrow is drawn between vertices - that's it
*** DONE new local action bar
CLOSED: [2011-08-05 Fri 13:22]
goes with [[*port%20to%20new%20controller][port to new controller]]
*** DONE port to new controller
CLOSED: [2011-08-05 Fri 13:22]
**** render previous panels with new infrastructure
**** rewrite to make use of controller
events should not be that informative

the controller knows whats going on, and whoever triggers an event
puts as much information in as sanely available
*** DONE (fix) CSS
CLOSED: [2011-08-05 Fri 13:23]
ideally seems: parse the overall structure vie js and assign fixed
positions according to horizontal/vertical weight of contained divs
**** requires
***** setting CSS via js
***** querying of browser size via js -> available space
--> deco grid
*** DONE display name of actions
CLOSED: [2011-08-05 Fri 13:24]
*** DONE clear rake hierarchy when raked action is removed
CLOSED: [2011-08-05 Fri 13:25]

CLOSED: [2011-08-05 Fri 13:24]
**** flags to enable hiding: left, top, right, bottom
**** handles to hide if enabled in an direction
**** global and layer-local mode
**** DONE rethink panes, how are they rerendered and learn about new activity
CLOSED: [2011-08-05 Fri 13:24]

CLOSED: [2011-08-05 Fri 17:00]
saving of properties does not work on tablet
*** DONE debug infrastructure for fennec (mobile firefox)

well - better than nothing
*** DONE fix spaceOut
CLOSED: [2011-08-11 Thu 16:40]
good enough
*** TODO labels for decisions
*** TODO merge path into other, ie. drag final node onto mimo
dragging of final node does not work on tablets
*** TODO edges to query source node for label
**** bind edges to their source node to update label
**** background: decmers provide their answers to be displayed on outedges
*** TODO removing must not select
*** TODO investigate keyup/down events in firefox, propertiesview
*** TODO json export/import to filesystem
*** TODO scrolling: move diagram around within one layer
*** TODO top-layer without edges
***** how do we place them?
*** TODO bottom-layer without rakes
** med prio
*** DONE fix existing tests
CLOSED: [2011-06-04 Sat 03:48]

CLOSED: [2011-08-05 Fri 13:25]
exist but without icon so far
*** DONE tool to measure test coverage
CLOSED: [2011-06-21 Tue 08:44]
**** firebug extension
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/code-coverage-v2-for-firebug/
however, with firebug 1.7.3 and firefox 5 the result varies from run
to run
**** jscoverage
http://siliconforks.com/jscoverage/
http://blog.siliconforks.com/2010/04/28/jscoverage-jquery/
looks good
*** DONE action library tool
CLOSED: [2011-08-05 Fri 13:25]

*** TODO print
**** 6 layers, one per page, landscape
**** zoom to fit?
**** generate pdf or use browser?
*** TODO decmer library tool,
**** like action lib but on decmers
**** show only decmers that have a name
*** TODO menubar undo
**** either in the save hooks or in the storage
**** keep git-like storage above localstorage in mind
***** would it help?
*** TODO drag preview
*** TODO collection set parent of their models, in add
the parent is used to generate the key for the storage. currently in
several places there is code to differentiate between
models/collection with parent set and models that are a member of
collections.

XXX: this might be outdated
*** TODO zooming within one layer
*** TODO draw rake symbol
*** TODO tests need to properly cleanup after themselves
**** properly destroy all elements
**** localstorage: remove empty keys
** low prio and easy
Theses tasks are meant for newbies to enter the project
*** TODO move drawing code into raphael plugin: raphael.fn.tapta?
*** TODO test coverage for view code?
