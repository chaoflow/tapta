** high prio
*** TODO rake area to show activity on next level
**** layers to generate initial activity for layer0
**** click rake area tells current layer to rake the action (persistent)
**** current layer tells next layer to show the activity
*** TODO menubar (from scratch)
**** action, decmer, forkjoin
**** drag item onto edge
**** menubar could have instances of the nodes
**** who handles the procedure?
*** TODO menubar delete
**** tell paths to remove the node
*** TODO generate new path
**** idea: drop new final node onto an area of a forkjoin/decmer
they have areas corresponding to the space: above, between and below
their outgoing edges
*** TODO merge path into other, ie. drag final node onto some node
*** TODO panes
**** flags to enable hiding: left, top, right, bottom
**** handles to hide if enabled in an direction
**** global and layer-local mode
*** TODO base class for tools to be docked in panes
*** TODO properties tool, layer-local, docked by default on the left
**** instant delayed update of changed properties
**** label and description
*** TODO action library tool, layer-local, docked by default on the right
**** show all actions of the layer
**** filter on action label (name is now used within the storage)
**** new node functionality via menubar
**** delete node
***** only if not used anywhere anymore
***** maybe not delete, but just blacklist
*** TODO edges to query source node for label
**** bind edges to their source node to update label
**** background: decmers provide their answers to be displayed on outedges
** med prio
*** TODO print
**** 6 layers, one per page, landscape
**** zoom to fit?
**** generate pdf or use browser?
*** TODO switch edges, ie change path order
*** TODO decmer library tool,
**** like action lib but on decmers
**** show only decmers that have a name
*** TODO menubar undo
**** either in the save hooks or in the storage
**** keep git-like storage above localstorage in mind
***** would it help?
*** TODO drag preview

** low prio and easy
Theses tasks are meant for newbies to enter the project

*** TODO top-layer without edges
***** how do we place them?
*** TODO bottom-layer without rakes
*** TODO collection set parent of their models, in add
the parent is used to generate the key for the storage. currently in
several places there is code to differentiate between
models/collection with parent set and models that are a member of
collections.
*** TODO move diagram around within one layer
*** TODO zooming within one layer
*** TODO draw rake symbol
*** TODO draw vertical lines for decmers
*** TODO tests need to properly cleanup after themselves
**** properly destroy all elements
**** localstorage: remove empty keys
*** TODO tool to measure test coverage
*** TODO full test coverage
**** for non-view
**** for view?
