** high prio
*** DONE fix ctrl areas of DecMer and ForkJoin
CLOSED: [2011-06-04 Sat 03:48]
size/position is wrong
more beautiful
*** DONE enable adding multiple in a row
CLOSED: [2011-06-04 Sat 03:46]
**** needs beautification of ctrl areas
*** DONE rake area to show activity on next level
CLOSED: [2011-05-20 Fri 09:24]
**** layers to generate initial activity for layer0
**** click rake area tells current layer to rake the action (persistent)
**** current layer tells next layer to show the activity
*** DONE menubar (from scratch)
CLOSED: [2011-05-25 Wed 21:53]
now layer-local
**** action, decmer, forkjoin
**** drag item onto edge
**** menubar could have instances of the nodes
**** who handles the procedure?
*** DONE menubar delete
CLOSED: [2011-06-04 Sat 03:47]
**** tell paths to remove the node
*** DONE generate new path
CLOSED: [2011-05-25 Wed 21:51]
**** idea: drop new final node onto an area of a forkjoin/decmer
they have areas corresponding to the space: above, between and below
their outgoing edges
*** DONE instrospection tool for data model
CLOSED: [2011-06-14 Tue 02:12]
there needs to be a debugger window that shows all paths and elements
in a concise way.

content of all collections with selected attributes, cid for a start

content of paths listing path idx and nodes as cid lists
*** DONE BUG: newpath with only MIMO leads to wrong insertion
CLOSED: [2011-06-14 Tue 02:12]
factor out stuff and write tests for it
*** DONE BUG: removing left last path with idx != 0
CLOSED: [2011-06-14 Tue 02:59]
factor out stuff and write tests for it
*** DONE Graph/vertices instead of paths
CLOSED: [2011-07-12 Tue 01:46]
*** DONE fix x_req/y_req - edges have also space and padding?
CLOSED: [2011-07-12 Tue 01:48]
elements have a size, optional x/y padding which needs to be accounted
for in the space allocation

--> edges have no real space, the edge area is drawn along the arrow,
    the arrow is drawn between vertices - that's it
*** DONE new local action bar
CLOSED: [2011-08-05 Fri 13:22]
goes with [[*port%20to%20new%20controller][port to new controller]]
*** DONE port to new controller
CLOSED: [2011-08-05 Fri 13:22]
**** render previous panels with new infrastructure

events should not be that informative

the controller knows whats going on, and whoever triggers an event
puts as much information in as sanely available
*** DONE (fix) CSS
CLOSED: [2011-08-05 Fri 13:23]
ideally seems: parse the overall structure vie js and assign fixed
positions according to horizontal/vertical weight of contained divs
**** requires
***** setting CSS via js
***** querying of browser size via js -> available space
--> deco grid
*** DONE display name of actions
CLOSED: [2011-08-05 Fri 13:24]

***** new node functionality via menubar
***** delete node
****** only if not used anywhere anymore
****** maybe not delete, but just blacklist
*** DONE new properties too
CLOSED: [2011-08-05 Fri 17:00]
saving of properties does not work on tablet
*** DONE debug infrastructure for fennec (mobile firefox)

*** DONE removing must not select
CLOSED: [2011-08-17 Wed 14:01]
*** DONE what is selected/raked? view vs vertex vs node
CLOSED: [2011-08-17 Wed 19:25]
Clicking a lib element changes the edit mode and selects the element.
Clicking an element in the graph could also change the edit mode, but
not necessarily.

The next layer displayes the activity/process associated with the selected

selected could be an attribute on the node, and all views bind to
change:selected on the nodes

the selected state is persistent and specific to the activity being
displayed.
--> node is selected and graph handles highlighting all vertices using it
*** DONE labels for decisions
CLOSED: [2011-08-18 Thu 09:00]
*** DONE port action lib to editmode/ops
CLOSED: [2011-08-19 Fri 12:04]

*** TODO linebreak labels
check svg spec how to achieve that - 1.2 tiny, unsupported, brings
textArea
https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikibooks/de/wiki/SVG/_Text_als_Graphik
*** TODO chrome/jquery eats mouseup if text is selected when starting to drag
svg element, dblclick, text outside svg is selected
dragndrop know stays after mouseup

either chrome should not dragndrop the selected area

or there should not be selection, anyway not outside svg when
dblclicking svg

or hear about the chrome dnd and abort tapta dnd

Theses tasks are meant for newbies to enter the project
*** TODO move drawing code into raphael plugin: raphael.fn.tapta?
*** TODO test coverage for view code?
*** TODO zooming within one layer
*** TODO tests need to properly cleanup after themselves
**** properly destroy all elements
**** localstorage: remove empty keys
*** TODO edges to query source node for label
postpone until we know whether we need it
**** bind edges to their source node to update label
**** background: decmers provide their answers to be displayed on outedges
*** TODO collection set parent of their models, in add
the parent is used to generate the key for the storage. currently in
several places there is code to differentiate between
models/collection with parent set and models that are a member of
collections.
