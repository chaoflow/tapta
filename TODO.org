** high prio
*** DONE fix ctrl areas of DecMer and ForkJoin
CLOSED: [2011-06-04 Sat 03:48]
size/position is wrong
more beautiful
*** DONE enable adding multiple in a row
CLOSED: [2011-06-04 Sat 03:46]
**** needs beautification of ctrl areas
*** DONE rake area to show activity on next level
CLOSED: [2011-05-20 Fri 09:24]
**** layers to generate initial activity for layer0
**** click rake area tells current layer to rake the action (persistent)
**** current layer tells next layer to show the activity
*** DONE menubar (from scratch)
CLOSED: [2011-05-25 Wed 21:53]
now layer-local
**** action, decmer, forkjoin
**** drag item onto edge
**** menubar could have instances of the nodes
**** who handles the procedure?
*** DONE menubar delete
CLOSED: [2011-06-04 Sat 03:47]
**** tell paths to remove the node
*** DONE generate new path
CLOSED: [2011-05-25 Wed 21:51]
**** idea: drop new final node onto an area of a forkjoin/decmer
they have areas corresponding to the space: above, between and below
their outgoing edges
*** DONE instrospection tool for data model
CLOSED: [2011-06-14 Tue 02:12]
there needs to be a debugger window that shows all paths and elements
in a concise way.

content of all collections with selected attributes, cid for a start

content of paths listing path idx and nodes as cid lists
*** DONE BUG: newpath with only MIMO leads to wrong insertion
CLOSED: [2011-06-14 Tue 02:12]
factor out stuff and write tests for it
*** DONE BUG: removing left last path with idx != 0
CLOSED: [2011-06-14 Tue 02:59]
factor out stuff and write tests for it
*** DONE Graph/vertices instead of paths
CLOSED: [2011-07-12 Tue 01:46]
*** DONE fix x_req/y_req - edges have also space and padding?
CLOSED: [2011-07-12 Tue 01:48]
elements have a size, optional x/y padding which needs to be accounted
for in the space allocation

--> edges have no real space, the edge area is drawn along the arrow,
    the arrow is drawn between vertices - that's it
*** TODO new local action bar
goes with [[*port%20to%20new%20controller][port to new controller]]
*** TODO port to new controller
**** render previous panels with new infrastructure
**** rewrite to make use of controller
events should not be that informative

the controller knows whats going on, and whoever triggers an event
puts as much information in as sanely available
*** TODO new properties too
*** TODO (fix) CSS
ideally seems: parse the overall structure vie js and assign fixed
positions according to horizontal/vertical weight of contained divs
**** requires
***** setting CSS via js
***** querying of browser size via js -> available space
*** TODO merge path into other, ie. drag final node onto mimo
*** TODO display name of actions
*** TODO panes
**** flags to enable hiding: left, top, right, bottom
**** handles to hide if enabled in an direction
**** global and layer-local mode
**** TODO rethink panes, how are they rerendered and learn about new activity
**** TODO base class for tools to be docked in panes
**** TODO properties tool, layer-local, docked by default on the left
***** instant delayed update of changed properties
***** label and description
**** TODO action library tool, layer-local, docked by default on the right
***** show all actions of the layer
***** filter on action label (name is now used within the storage)
***** new node functionality via menubar
***** delete node
****** only if not used anywhere anymore
****** maybe not delete, but just blacklist
*** TODO edges to query source node for label
**** bind edges to their source node to update label
**** background: decmers provide their answers to be displayed on outedges
*** TODO clear rake hierarchy when raked action is removed
** med prio
*** DONE fix existing tests
CLOSED: [2011-06-04 Sat 03:48]
*** TODO select arrow (for properties) icon
exist but without icon so far
*** TODO print
**** 6 layers, one per page, landscape
**** zoom to fit?
**** generate pdf or use browser?
*** TODO action library tool
*** TODO decmer library tool,
**** like action lib but on decmers
**** show only decmers that have a name
*** TODO menubar undo
**** either in the save hooks or in the storage
**** keep git-like storage above localstorage in mind
***** would it help?
*** TODO drag preview
*** TODO collection set parent of their models, in add
the parent is used to generate the key for the storage. currently in
several places there is code to differentiate between
models/collection with parent set and models that are a member of
collections.

XXX: this might be outdated
*** TODO move diagram around within one layer
*** TODO zooming within one layer
*** TODO draw rake symbol
*** TODO draw vertical lines for decmers
*** TODO tests need to properly cleanup after themselves
**** properly destroy all elements
**** localstorage: remove empty keys
*** DONE tool to measure test coverage
CLOSED: [2011-06-21 Tue 08:44]
**** firebug extension
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/code-coverage-v2-for-firebug/
however, with firebug 1.7.3 and firefox 5 the result varies from run
to run
**** jscoverage
http://siliconforks.com/jscoverage/
http://blog.siliconforks.com/2010/04/28/jscoverage-jquery/
looks good
*** DONE full test coverage
CLOSED: [2011-07-12 Tue 01:49]
**** for non-view
--> mostly done
**** for view?
--> not sure how to do: new ticket
*** TODO test coverage for view code?
*** TODO move ctrl area style to css?
*** TODO move drawing code into raphael plugin: raphael.fn.tapta?
** low prio and easy
Theses tasks are meant for newbies to enter the project
*** TODO top-layer without edges
***** how do we place them?
*** TODO bottom-layer without rakes
